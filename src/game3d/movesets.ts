/**
 * AshLane per-character movesets — Tekken / Soulcalibur / Urban Reign style.
 *
 * Every named character gets their own unique movelist with Tekken-style input
 * notation, frame data, and animation-clip bindings. Picking a different
 * character FEELS different.
 *
 * Move-structure inspiration: SchwarzerblitzEngine's FK_Move
 * (mhvnsnt/SchwarzerblitzEngine — startup/active/recovery, hitboxes,
 * throw escapes, followups, counter-attack windows).
 * Input notation: Tekken convention (see INPUT_LEGEND in docs/MOVESETS.md).
 *
 * Clip bindings reference real assets:
 *   - bank.json keys (50 clips: boxing, chokeslam, german, suplex, ddt, ...)
 *   - UAL clips (Punch_Jab, Punch_Cross, Melee_Hook, Hit_Chest, ...)
 * Clips that don't exist yet are marked TODO_CLIP and fall back to the
 * nearest bank.json clip at runtime (see resolveClip()).
